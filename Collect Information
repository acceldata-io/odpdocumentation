Before deploying a cluster, gather the following information:

* The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of each host in your system. The Ambari Cluster Install wizard supports using IP addresses. You can use the hostname -f command to check or verify the FQDN of a host.

* A list of components you want to set up on each host.

* The base directories you want to use as mount points to store the following:

    - NameNode data
    - DataNodes data
    - Secondary NameNode data
    - Oozie data
    - YARN data
    - ZooKeeper data
    - Various log, pid, and db files, depending on your install type
