The Customize Services step presents you with a set of tabs that let you review and modify your cluster setup. The Cluster Install wizard attempts to set reasonable defaults for each of the options. You are strongly encouraged to review these settings as your requirements might be more advanced.

Ambari groups the commonly customized configuration elements together into four categories: Credentials, Databases, Directories, and Accounts. All other configuration will be available in the All Configurations section of the Installation Wizard.

# Credentials

Passwords for administrator and database accounts are grouped together for easy input. Depending on the services chosen, you will be prompted to input the required passwords for each item, and have the option to change the username used for administrator accounts.

Ranger and Atlas require strong passwords for your security. Hover over each property to see its password requirements. Passwords that do not meet these requirements will be highlighted on the All Configurations tab at the end of the Customize Services step.
