# Introduction to Ambari Server

The Apache Ambari project simplifies Hadoop management. The Ambari project allows you to provision, manage, and monitor Apache Hadoop clusters. Ambari project comes with an intuitive, easy-to-use Hadoop management UI. Ambari also provides RESTful APIs for Hadoop management.

With Ambari project, system administrators can perform the following tasks.

* Provision a Hadoop Cluster
* Use a step-by-step wizard to install Hadoop services across any number of hosts.
* Handle configuration of Hadoop services for the cluster.
* Manage a Hadoop Cluster.
* Centrally manage the process of starting, stopping, and reconfiguring Hadoop services across the entire cluster.
* Monitor a Hadoop Cluster.
* Use a dashboard for monitoring health and status of the Hadoop cluster.
* Leverage [Ambari Metrics System](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-5707) for metrics collection.
* Leverage [Ambari Alert Framework](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-6354) for system alerting and will notify you when your attention is needed (e.g., a node goes down, remaining disk space is low, etc).

Ambari allows Application Developers and System Integrators to:

Easily integrate Hadoop provisioning, management, and monitoring capabilities to their own applications with the [Ambari REST APIs](https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-server/docs/api/v1/index.md).
