Acceldata supports the Open-Source Data Platform. To use the Acceldata supported Open-Source Data Platform (ODP), you must install it. This documentation explains the installation process of Acceldata Open-Source Data Platform (ODP). 

# Advantages of ODP

* To allow Data driven enterprises to benefit from Open-source data platform software available through various Apache projects and communities.
* To provide an option to enterprises to continue with their Big Data Hadoop journey without being locked in proprietary platforms. 
* Curate and build a community of enterprise stakeholders around ingestion, storage, compute, and security projects to share best practices.
* Play an active role in creation and sharing of platform binaries, manageability and monitoring software which allows enterprises to make their open-source ambitions possible.

# Open Source Data Platform Specifications

## Component Versions

This section provides a list of the official Apache component versions for Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP). To ensure that you are working with the most recent stable software available, you must be familiar with the latest Apache component versions in HDP. You should also be aware of the available Technical Preview components and use them only in a testing environment.

The Acceldata approach is to provide patches only when necessary, to ensure the interoperability of components. Unless you are explicitly directed by Acceldata Support to install a patch, each of the HDP components should remain at the following package version levels to ensure a certified and supported copy of HDP.
